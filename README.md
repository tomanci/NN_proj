# Neural Network Project
*Made by*: **Ancilli Tommaso, University of Siena**

## How to use the script

## Brief description of the files
**ANN.py** contains the classes of the neural networks implemented

the idea i want to implement in the generator class is to replicate an Autoencoder. The reverse bottle neck is given by the third layer where it has the deepest channels 

**Dataset_creator.py** contains the method to download and pre-processing the dataset

**Requirements.py** carries the libraries
